                "3. Boxing was only legalized as a sport in 1900. Prior to that, he was considered too cruel and unsuitable for the presence of a possible public. In the 20th century, boxing became the most popular sport in cinema.",
                "4. Ancient Greek Olympic athletes competed completely naked. All Olympic competitions provided for the complete nakedness of athletes. The very name of the modern word \"gymnastics\" comes from the ancient Greek \"gymos\", that is, \"naked\". Somehow, they still tried to dress the athletes, but this innovation did not take root at all.",

A modern hockey puck is made of vulcanized rubber and weighs only 200 grams. Before the start of the game, it is frozen so that it does not spring.",

Jamaican track and field athlete, specializing in sprint, nine-time Olympic champion and 11-time world champion (a record in the history of these competitions). During his performances, he set 8 world records. World record holder in the 100 - 9.58; and 200 meters - 19.19, as well as in the 4 Ã— 100 meters relay as part of the Jamaican national team - 36.84.",
                "8. In the Spanish Second League match between San Isidro and Olimpico Carrante, a few minutes before the end of the game, the players of the two teams, completely dissatisfied with the refereeing, surrounded the referee to explain to him how to referee. And not only with words and gestures. In this critical situation, the referee, keeping complete calm, took out a red card and presented it to all twenty-two participants in the match.",
                "9. Athletes jumping from a springboard on skis should not be wished for a fair wind - it only harms them. A headwind is much better, thanks to which an air cushion is created in front of the skier in flight, and he flies further. To start the jump, athletes are given a certain time, during which the coaches try to choose the optimal start time, taking into account the wind. Wind changes during the course of the competition can make the conditions for the participants unequal: if the skier got only a tailwind, his chances for medals, even with the best technique, are sharply reduced.",
                "10. The rules of horse racing state that the length of the name of a racing horse should not exceed eighteen letters. Names that are too long are cumbersome to record.",

                "14. People began to play bowling as early as 3200 BC, this is evidenced by a collection of objects found in an Egyptian tomb that resemble primitive bowling tools.",
                "15. The billiard game of snooker fell into decline in the mid-20th century. However, interest in her again greatly increased after the BBC channel chose her to demonstrate the benefits of color television and began to broadcast all the championships. The green table and multi-colored snooker balls were perfect for this purpose."
